# PrintScreen

## why?

Windows already has this functionality (Winkey+PrintScreen). Why re-invent the wheel?

Well, that is a keyboard shortcut. When you don't have a keyboard attached to the computer (ie, phone, tablet), there is no easy way to print screen! (that I know of, please let me know if I'm wrong)

This project aims to fix that. It adds a small icon in the system tray that allows you to click to save a screenshot in the folder where other screenshots /should/ be saved (My Pictures\Screenshots).

It's also second-safe, so if you want to save screenshots more than once per second, it's okay too (there's a 1/90 chance of a file getting duplicated if you take two screenshots within a second).

## download

download the file in `bin/Debug/PS.exe`.
